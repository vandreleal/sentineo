    term: 'ephemeris',
    definition:
      'An ephemeris is a tabulation of computed positions and velocities (and/or various derived quantities such as right ascension and declination) of an orbiting body at specific times. The plural form of ephemeris is ephemerides.',

  {
    term: 'keyhole',
    definition:
      'A usually narrow region of a pre-impact b-plane in which the gravitational effect of the encounter puts the asteroid on a trajectory which impacts at a later encounter. In other words, if the object passes through a keyhole in one b-plane, it is on course to collide with the Earth at the potentially impacting encounter.',

    term: 'LD (Lunar Distance)',
    definition:
      'The term LD (Lunar Distance) refers to the average distance between the Earth and Moon. For data reported on this site, we use a mean semimajor axis for the moon of 384400 km (~.002570 au) to define one LD.',
  },
  {
    term: 'line of nodes',
    definition:
      'The line of intersection between the orbit plane and the plane of the ecliptic (the Earth’s orbit plane). (Not defined if orbit lies exactly in the plane of the ecliptic.)',

  {
    term: 'PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid)',
    definition:
      'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroid’s potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth. Specifically, all asteroids with a minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered PHAs.',
